# Form Data & Validation Demo

This project demonstrates how to generate a FormData object and perform form validation using built-in HTML5 attributes along with JavaScript.

## Features

- **HTML5 Validation:** Utilizes `required`, `pattern`, and `minlength` attributes to validate user input.
- **FormData API:** Creates a FormData object on form submission to capture and manipulate form data.
- **JavaScript Integration:** Prevents the default form submission, validates input, logs the form data entries to the browser console, and notifies the user upon successful submission.

## How to Run

Assignment #1 Week 3, Day 2
1. Look at the first Name input in the form. Make sure that it has the html form validation attributes type=text, a minlength, and it is required.
2. Create a <p> underneath the input where the error message will go. This must have a unique ID you can use in the JS file.
3. Create a JS file where you can create custom form validation. The JS file should have:
- Select the elements you need by using document.getElementByID
- Create a function that
Has an if statement that checks the validity of the name input
If the input is not valid, then use .textContent to show an error message in the error message container (this is the <p> you created)
Then Add the submit event listener to the form, so that it runs when you click the submit button.
